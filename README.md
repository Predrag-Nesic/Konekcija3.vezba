# Konekcija3.vezba

This is one simple excercise where I was playing around with the connection to the server, inserting and extracting data from the database.
The method in the UsluzneMetode class called "ubaciKorisnika()" was my simple creation.

I still need to get used to the SQL syntax... Java syntax is more appealing to me.

Hope you like it.

Let me know if it needs refactoring.

Cheers...
